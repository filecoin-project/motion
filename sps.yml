default:
  # This is the domain/IP you will expose publicly to transfer data to storage providers
  # When you initialize the singularity docker setup, it will start a server to deliver
  # content to storage providers on localhost:7778. However, you will need to either
  # open this specific port on your firewall, and set this value to http://~your-static-ip~:7778
  # or you will need to setup reverse proxying from a dedicated web server like NGinx
  # By default, this is set to empty string to send offline deals which requires SP to import manually.
  content_provider_domain: ""
  # Frequency (as a cron tab expression) with which motion should attempt to make
  # new Filecoin deals. Defaults to every minute

  # Maximum number of deals motion should attempt to make when checking for new deals.
  # Defaults to 1
  schedule_deal_count: 1
  # Specifies whether motion deals are made with FIL+ Data Cap allocation. In order to use this, you must apply for
  # and receive a data cap allocation for your deals. In general, we recommend only those familiar with the Fil+
  # application process use FIL+, and instead contract out of band with storage providers to make non verified (non Fil+)
  # deals.

  # ON-CHAIN price per gigabyte for motion deals
  # In general, paid deals for motion should be negotiated in out of band contracts
  # and there is no reason to change this value

  # Another way to specify on-chain pricing for deals. There is no reason to change this value

  # Maximum delay time (in nanoseconds) between when a motion deal is proposed and when it's expected to be on chain.
  # Defaults to 72 hours. In general, you should not change this unless your contract specifies something
  # different.
  deal_start_delay_ns: 259200000000000
  # Initial total duration for motion deals stored on filecoin (specified in nanoseconds).
